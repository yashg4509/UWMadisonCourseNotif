              becomes waitlisted. Say goodbye to repeatedly refreshing the
              course registration page or relying on outdated information.

              elective that piques your interest, EnrollBadger will keep an eye
              on them for you. No more missed opportunities or last-minute
              scrambles during enrollment periods.
