# enRollBadge
This is the code that powers enRollBadge, a notification system that allows UW Madison the ability to get notified whenever certain classes open up or waitlist seats open up. 

For more information, check out https://enrollbadge.com/. 

Also, we had to split our interface code, so to learn more about the interface, visit https://github.com/yashg4509/enRollBadgeInterface.

Hope you enjoy the app!
